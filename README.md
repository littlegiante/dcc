# Developer Code Chalange with Node.js

This script was written to perform a search top five ice cream shops in Alpharetta with review. As per instruction Yelp-Fusion API used for that.

# Without reinventing the wheel again
As the Yelp fusion already provide a starter wrapper for the API so I have used that NPM-Package (yelp-fusion: https://github.com/tonybadguy/yelp-fusion). Which should be compatible with Node.js 4 and higher.

## Setup

Clone the repo:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/littlegiante/dcc.git
```

Go into the directory:

```
$ cd dcc
```

Install the dependences:

```
$ npm install 
```

## Usage

Once you're all setup, you should be able to run the script directly from the command line:

```
$ node index.js
```


```
